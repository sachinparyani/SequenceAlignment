# SequenceAlignment
Java implementation of sequence alignment techniques that are frequently used in Bioinformatics

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of the following sequence alignment strategies
1. Global Alignment
2. Local Alignment
3. End space free (dove-tail) alignment

There are several ways to implement an alignment strategy, but the ones used here are based on **Needleman-Wunsch** and **Smith-Waterman** methods. 

## Running the code

## What is in it for you?

You can benefit from this repository in multiple ways.
1. If you're looking for a quick implementation of one of the above mentioned alignment strategies, you've come to the right place. 
2. If you want to compare the results of your implementation of the above alignment strategies with some other implentation, you can do that. 
3. Lastly, if you want to see a good use-case of dynamic programming, this is a good place to start since all the implementations are done using dynamic programming (basically variations of the [edit-distance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-5-edit-distance/) problem)

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to this repo, for example if you would like to add an implementation of newer or more sophisticated alignment strategy, please feel free to do so.
